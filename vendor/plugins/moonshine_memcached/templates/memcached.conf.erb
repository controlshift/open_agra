# memcached default config file
# 2003 - Jay Bonci <jaybonci@debian.org>
# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as
# part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. 

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more
# information.
-d

# Log memcached's output to /var/log/memcached
logfile <%= options[:log_file] || '/var/log/memcached.log' %>

<%= options[:extra] %>

# Be verbose
# -v

# Be even more verbose (print client commands as well)
# -vv

# Start with a cap of 64 megs of memory. It's reasonable, and the daemon default
# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory
-m <%= options[:max_memory] || '64' %>

# Default connection port is 11211
-p <%= options[:port] || '11211' %>

# Run the daemon as root. The start-memcached will default to running as root if no
# -u command is present in this config file
-u <%= options[:user] || 'nobody' %>

# Specify which IP address to listen on. The default is to listen on all IP addresses
# This parameter is one of the only security measures that memcached has, so make sure
# it's listening on a firewalled interface.
-l <%= options[:listen_address] || '127.0.0.1' %>

# Limit the number of simultaneous incoming connections. The daemon default is 1024
-c <%= options[:max_connections] || '1024' %>

# Lock down all paged memory. Consult with the README and homepage before you do this
<%= '-k' if options[:lock_paged_memory] %>

# Return error when memory is exhausted (rather than removing items)
<%= '-M' if options[:disable_auto_remove] %>

# Maximize core file limit
<%= '-r' if options[:maximize_core_size] %>
