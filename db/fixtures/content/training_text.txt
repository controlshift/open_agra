<p>Thanks for stepping up to be the leader of this local campaign! It's an incredible thing to do - taking on responsibility to make change in your community.</p>

<p>As leader, you'll be in charge of getting signatures for your local petition, holding events and sending emails to your supporters. You'll also be the contact point between your local campaign and the national campaign.</p>

<p>Start sharing your campaign with your networks online straight away. As this is a local campaign, gathering signatures for the petition on the streets will also be key to its success. It's easy: print out your petition, talk to people about why this is important, collect their details and enter them back into the site.</p>

<p>As your campaign grows you can email the people who have signed your petition and ask them to do more: to share the campaign, to show up to an event, to contact a decision maker... it's up to you! Someone from the national campaign will be in touch with suggestions on what actions you can ask your supporters to take once they've signed the petition.</p>

<p>Running a successful campaign takes a bit of time so it's a good idea to assemble a team to help support you with the various tasks involved. Our team will also be here along the way to help out.</p>
