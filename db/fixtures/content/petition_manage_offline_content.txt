  You can grow your campaign by collecting signatures at street fairs, markets, and other places where people gather. Here are
  some ideas for offline signature gathering campaigns that you could consider.

<ul>
  <li>Setup a table at your local farmer's market.</li>
  <li>Invite friends and neighbors over for a meeting to talk about the issue.</li>
  <li>Talk to other parents picking up their children from school or at classroom events.</li>
</ul>

  Use our printable petition form to collect signatures, and then come back to this site to quickly enter the signatures that you
  gather. By adding the offline signatures you collect to the site you'll be able to reach those people via email, grow your total,
  and easily deliver the signatures to your target.
