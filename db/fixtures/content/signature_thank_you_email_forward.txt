Dear Friends,
</p>

<p>
I just signed the campaign: {{ signature.petition.title | escape }}
</p>

<p>
It would mean the world to me if you could also add your name to this important issue.
Every name that is added builds momentum around the campaign and makes it more likely for us to get the change we want to see.
</p>

<p>
Will you join me by taking action on this campaign?

After you've signed the petition please also take a moment to share it with others.  It's super easy â€“ all you need to do is forward this email.
</p>


<p>
Thank you!
<p>
